I moved the **list of Translation work list for Santali Language** content to my blog post. [Come here to see the list of app to be translated](https://santhalimingle.blogspot.com/2020/10/santali-app-translation-list-can-be.html).
SantaliToEnglish.txt - This is a file which will be helpful in future for those who want some translation pairs of sentences from Santali to English language. I release this file under CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0).
You can get more language translation pair files from [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/en/sentences/show_all_in/sat/none).
